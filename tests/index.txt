# This file lists the subdirectories that contain test cases. The format is
# very simple. Empty lines and lines with the "#" character at the first
# column are ignored and all other lines contain names of the subdirectories
# to be scanned for test cases, one name per line. Each of these lines
# contains the name of the test directory in its first word and a short
# description of the test directory (to be shown to the user) in the
# remaining words.
#
# The remaining files in the root directory are test library modules loaded
# by the test cases.
